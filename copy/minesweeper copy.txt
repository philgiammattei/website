Introducing
MINECRAFT: Creeper Sweeper!
(or, "Mine-Sweeper" for short)

I was born...
2000 or after
A wholly original new game that turns Minecraft blocks into a fun logic puzzler!
1999 or before
Microsoft's classic Minesweeper, with Minecraft art and sound.

break stone blocks to find treasure, but watch out for creepers.

The type of block you discover will give you clues to nearby creepers.

The number in each block corresponds to the number of creepers nearby (diagonals count!).  Use deduction (or good guesses) to steer clear of danger.

Click/tap a stone block to mark a suspected creeper block with redstone.  hold to break it, revealing what's underneath.

You win when you break every block but the creeper blocks!  The Creeper Counter will track your progress, but only if you accurately use the redstone markers.

you lose if you discover a creeper.
